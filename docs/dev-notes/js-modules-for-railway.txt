Copy this JSONB array for JavaScript course modules to insert into Railway:

[{"id":"js-m0","title":"Welcome (Course Overview)","type":"video","videoUrl":"https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4","duration":"3:12","description":"A short intro to what you will learn in this JavaScript mini-course: variables, functions, DOM manipulation, and building interactive web apps."},{"id":"js-m1","title":"The Mic Check (Output)","type":"practice","theory":"## Outputting Data in JavaScript\n\nIn JavaScript, we communicate with the outside world using the `console.log()` function. This is your best friend for debugging and testing code.\n\n### The console.log() Function\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\");\nconsole.log(42);\nconsole.log(true);\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Strings must be wrapped in quotes (single `'` or double `\"`)\n- Numbers and booleans don't need quotes\n- You can log multiple values: `console.log(\"Score:\", 100)`\n\n### Why Console Logging Matters\nDuring development, you'll use `console.log()` constantly to:\n- Check variable values\n- Debug your code\n- Understand program flow\n- Test your logic","instruction":"**Step 1:** Type the function name `console.log`\n**Step 2:** Add parentheses `()` after the function name\n**Step 3:** Inside the parentheses, type the string `\"Hello World\"`\n**Step 4:** End with a semicolon `;`\n**Step 5:** Run your code to see the output!","initialCode":"// Welcome to JavaScript!\n// Your mission: Print \"Hello World\" to the console\n\n","language":"javascript","expectedOutput":"Hello World","hints":["Start by typing: console","Add .log after console: console.log","Add parentheses: console.log()","Put your message in quotes inside: console.log(\"Hello World\")","Full solution: console.log(\"Hello World\");"],"solution":"console.log(\"Hello World\");","stepRequirements":[["console"],["console.log"],["console.log("],["\"Hello World\"","'Hello World'"],[";"]]}]

NOTE: This is just the first 2 modules as an example. The full array would be extremely long. Would you like me to:
1. Generate the complete JSONB for all JS modules in a file?
2. Create a script to convert the file for you?
3. Show you just a few modules at a time?
